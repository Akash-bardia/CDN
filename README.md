Content Delivery Network Optimization
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on Content Delivery Network (CDN) Optimization. It demonstrates techniques to analyze and improve the efficiency of CDNs using Python and graph-based algorithms.

Features
Implementation of custom graph structures for network simulation.
Visualization of CDN topologies and optimization results using Plotly.
Performance analysis through algorithms that simulate traffic, edge weighting, and more.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
networkx
numpy
plotly

To install the required libraries, run:
pip install networkx numpy plotly

Usage

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Content-Delivery-Network-Optimization.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd CDN

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook "Content Delivery Network Optimization.ipynb"
Run the cells step-by-step to explore the CDN optimization process.
